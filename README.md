> This repository houses the code for our senior design project as part of **Senior Electrical Engineering Projects (ECE 395 & 396)**—a two-semester course offered in Fall 2024 and Spring 2025 at The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Arts and Science.

## Course Overview

In Senior Projects, groups of students collaborate on a single design project. Throughout the course, students move from conceptual design and budgeting through to testing and performance evaluation, all while being guided by a faculty advisor.

## Instructor

**Professor Sam Keene**

## Project Description

Our project, *Low Powered Face Misclassification: Toward Ethical and Efficient On-Device Facial Recognition*, explores how quantization influences the performance and explainability of face recognition models. We are comparing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures—both fine-tuned on VGGFace2—for face identification and verification tasks. By testing models at different precision levels (such as FP32, FP16, and INT8) and using explainable AI tools like Grad-CAM, we aim to reveal how quantization impacts feature extraction and overall performance on low-powered devices, such as the Jetson Nano Super.
