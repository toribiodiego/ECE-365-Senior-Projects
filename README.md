> This repository houses the code for our senior design project as part of **Senior Electrical Engineering Projects (ECE 395)**—a two-semester course offered in Fall 2024 and Spring 2025 at The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Arts and Science.

## Course Overview

In Senior Electrical Engineering Projects, students work in small groups to tackle design challenges that blend research and product development. Throughout the course, you'll engage in all facets of project management—from conceptual design, scheduling, and budgeting to hardware/software implementation, testing, and performance evaluation. The course also emphasizes effective communication through both oral presentations and written reports.

## Project Description

Our project, *Low Powered Face Misclassification: Toward Ethical and Efficient On-Device Facial Recognition*, explores how quantization influences the performance and explainability of face recognition models. We are comparing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures—both fine-tuned on VGGFace2—for face identification and verification tasks. By testing models at different precision levels (such as FP32, FP16, and INT8) and using explainable AI tools like Grad-CAM, we aim to reveal how quantization impacts feature extraction and overall performance on low-powered devices, such as the Jetson Nano Super.
