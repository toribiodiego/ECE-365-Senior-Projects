> This repository contains the code for **ECE 395 & 396: Senior Electrical Engineering Projects**, a two-semester course offered in Fall 2024 and Spring 2025 at The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Arts and Science, featuring our project exploring the impact of quantization on face recognition models to enhance performance and explainability on low-powered devices.


## Senior Projects
**Course, Fall 2024 & Spring 2025**  
**Instructor:** Professor Sam Keene
**Team Members:** Diego Toribio & Nicholas Storniolo


###  Overview

This course is a year-long, hands-on journey where students work in small groups to tackle real-world challenges in electrical and computer engineering. From project planning and budgeting to designing systems, building hardware and software, and evaluating performance, students cover it all. Along the way, they also sharpen their communication skills through regular presentations and written reports, preparing them for future research or industry roles.

### Final Project

Our project, *Low Powered Face Misclassification: Toward Ethical and Efficient On-Device Facial Recognition*, explores how quantization influences the performance and explainability of face recognition models. We are comparing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures—both fine-tuned on VGGFace2—for face identification and verification tasks. By testing models at different precision levels (such as FP32, FP16, and INT8) and using explainable AI tools, we aim to reveal how quantization impacts feature extraction and overall performance on low-powered devices, such as the Jetson Nano Super.
