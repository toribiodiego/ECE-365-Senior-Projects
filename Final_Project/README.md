## Low-Powered Face Misclassification: Toward Ethical & Efficient On-Device Facial Recognition  

All training scripts, evaluation notebooks, pretrained checkpoints, and experiment logs live here. The repository benchmarks ResNet-18 and Vision Transformer backbones fine-tuned on VGGFace2, then sweeps through FP32 → FP16 → INT8 quantization to study speed, energy, and privacy trade-offs on hardware such as the Jetson Nano.

### Objective  
Measure how precision reduction influences (1) face-ID accuracy, (2) latency and memory footprint, and (3) saliency-based explainability. By systematically comparing full- and low-bit-width models—and visualizing which facial regions remain salient after quantization—we aim to publish a validated recipe for fast, privacy-preserving face recognition on resource-constrained devices.
